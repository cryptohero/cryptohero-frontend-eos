    <!--a sizable army before they are eventually granted amnesty by the government and sent on campaigns to resist foreign invaders-->
    <!--and suppress rebel forces. It has introduced to readers many of the best-known characters in Chinese literature, such-->
    <!--as Wu Song, Lin Chong and Lu Zhishen.</p>-->
